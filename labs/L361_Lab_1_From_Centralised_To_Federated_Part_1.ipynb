        "Welcome to the first lab in our Federated Learning (FL) course. This series of labs intends to introduce you to the practice of constructing Federated Learning systems. The most common form of FL, cross-device FL, is concerned with collaboratively training models on edge devices or “clients'' encapsulating their private data. As such, FL may:\n",
        "- Reduce communication costs by only sharing model parameters.\n",
        "- Distribute computation across a pool of previously unused devices.\n",
        "- Partially preserve privacy by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "A typical server-client FL system maintains a centralised server that synchronises training across iterations of rounds---the FL equivalent of epochs. A round generally proceeds as follows:\n",
        "1. At the beginning of a round, the server sends a copy of the federated model to each client.\n",
        "2. The clients then train their copy of the model on the private data they hold and send the post-training model updates to the server.\n",
        "3. The server then aggregates all the client models to form a single federated model update which it applies before the next round. The most common means of aggregation is Federated Averaging which merges model parameters via simple weighted averaging."

        "To a more significant extent than other ML fields, FL has historically been driven by practical considerations rather than theoretical results. Some main practical concerns in the field are related to the following:\n",

        "- The underlying non-standardized hardware of clients within the federated network.\n",
        "- Highly divergent data distributions across clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "Such issues cannot be easily corrected, given FL's privacy and scale constraints, as persistent data on specific clients may not be trackable. In a worst-case setting, a single client may only participate in training once for cross-device FL with millions of potential devices.\n",
        "\n",
